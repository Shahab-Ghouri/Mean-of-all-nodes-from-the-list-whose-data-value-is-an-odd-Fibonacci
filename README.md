# Mean-of-all-nodes-from-the-list-whose-data-value-is-an-odd-Fibonacci
Given a singly linked list containing N nodes, the task is to find the mean of all the distinct nodes from the list whose data value is an odd Fibonacci number.


Examples:
Input: LL = 5 -> 21 -> 8 ->12-> 3 -> 13 ->144 -> 6
Output 10.5
Explanation:
Fibonacci Nodes present in the Linked List are {5, 21, 8, 3, 13, 144}
Odd Fibonacci Nodes present in the List are {5, 21, 3, 13}
Count of Odd Fibonacci Nodes is 4
Therefore , Mean of Odd Fibonacci Node Values = (5 + 21 + 3 + 13) / 4 = 10.5



Input: LL = 55 -> 3 -> 91 -> 89 -> 76 -> 233 -> 34 -> 87 -> 5 -> 100
Output:77
Explanation:
Fibonacci Nodes present in the Linked List are {55, 3, 89, 233, 34, 5}
Odd Fibonacci Nodes present in the Linked List are { 55,3,89,233,5 }
Count of Odd Fibonacci Nodes is 5
Therefore , Mean of ODD Fibonacci Node Values  = ( 55 + 5 + 3 + 89 + 233 ) / 5 = 77
